# About me
I'm interested in technology in general, particularly in building software
solutions to engineering challenges. I find space systems especially
interesting, due to the requirement of high quality of the processes and
documentation involved. I like well-defined requirements, reading and writing
good documentation and introducing automatization to repetetive tasks.
A need to automatize the most time-consuming tasks was my main drive to learn
`bash` scripting language.

I use `vim`, btw.
